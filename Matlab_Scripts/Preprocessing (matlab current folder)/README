Read me: AudreyPreprocessingReg explanation

%%%%%Script to preprocess data for Visage experiments (JPE) 32 electrodes cap (-po10).

% Input: Raw eeg data *.edf (eeg continuous)
% Output: *.erp, (event related potentials) *.set files, *txt (Preprocessed, pruned
% with ICA, 0.1hz-50hz filtering, AR...) 
% 
%IMPORTANT
% 1)SCRIPT NEEDS TO BE IN 'OUTPUT' folder in current folder. But run script from cd!!.
% 2) Run section per section (in Editor > Run and Advance NOT 'RUN')
% 3) Need to remove bad electrodes to run AR. 
% 4) Automatic channel rejection runs twice per participant. The first will
% not pop up (check for bad channels in command window). The second time
% will (choose: Measure 'probability')

SECTION 1 l1-99
Input .edf (first two characters of the name should be the pair number (01, 02..20)
-The code selects the edf file found in current folder and import eeg data & event info.
-Correction of a data acquisition problem with event timing. 
Output: 
1) 4 sets per participant containing 8 electrodes
   filename: 'part_01_1'..'part_01_8' 
2) Merged sets (4 into 1) for each participant. Set files containing 32 channels, event info.
  filename: '1_01H1' '1_01H2'
  
  %%%%SECTION 1 l100-174
%Input: Merged sets 
    filename: '1_01H1' '1_01H2'
%Output
  - 2 sets files for each participant (=4 sets)
  1) 2 set files with 30 electrodes (duplicate of fc1 and po10 (bad across participants) removed)
  with 0.1hz highpass filter and 50hz lowpass filter.
      filename: '0.1hz_01_H1' '0.1hz_01_H2'
  2) 2 set files with 30 electrodes (duplicate of fc1 and po10 (bad across participants) removed)
  with 1hz highpass filter
       filename: '1hz_01_H1' '1hz_01_H2'
