%%%%%READ ME FOR AudreyPreprocessingReg. Script to preprocess data for Visage experiments (JPE) 32 electrodes cap (-po10) Mixed 5 conditions, paires of participants.
% 
%%%% Input: Raw eeg data *.EDF (eeg continuous) containing data for a paire of
% participants (H1&H2) recorded simultaneously (H1: first 32 channels of
% file; H2: last 32 channels). 
%
%%%% Output: *.erp, (event related potentials) *.set files (Preprocessed, pruned
% with ICA, 0.1hz-50hz filtering, AR...), , *txt (Artifact Rejection
% summary) for H1 & H2
% 
%!! IMPORTANT READ BEFORE RUNNING !!!
% 
% 1) Run section per section (in Editor > Run and Advance not 'Run')
% 2) This script requires some manual input
%       a) Pop-up version of ICA (Check that correct channels are selected
%       i.e that *bad* channels are not included) for H1 and H2
%       b) Pop-up version of Automatic Channel Rejection: change measure
%       from Kurtosis to Probability. 
%       c) Channels that were rejected during the Automatic Rejection AFTER ICA
%          should be written down.
% 3) Artifact Rejection QUICK guide (Last section, after ICA)
%       a) Run Artifact Rejection once on all 28 electrodes. 
%       b) Run Artifact a second time removing channels with lots of artifacts
%          (See in Artifact rejection pop-up, channels that cause a lot of
%          trials to be rejected.) Should coincide with channels marked
%          *bad* by automatic channel rejection. 
%       c)Take note of bad channels. Double check which channels are bad by
%       plotting ERPs before recalculating bad channels.
%%structure
% 4) In current folder create a folder named "output". Output files will
% be created there. 
% 5) Input .EDF filename format: 1:2 characters = pair number (01, 02...)
