Readme: 'output' is an empty folder where the output of the script 'AudreyPreprocessReg' will be created. All the files created will be worth archiving 
but only the last .set files, erp and .txt contain the finished output of the script. 
Note: Electrode recalculation is still to be done after end of script. Plot erpsets to check bad channels before electrode recalc.
